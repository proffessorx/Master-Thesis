abstract = {With the increasing applications of fully autonomous vehicles, efficient motion coordination of multiautonomous vehicles becomes a very important problem as it significantly affects the productivity. This problem is even harder to solve with the increases of the number of autonomous vehicles employed in a dynamic changing environment and constraints to vehicle movement. This paper presents a simultaneous path and motion planning (SiPaMoP) approach to coordinate motions of multi-autonomous vehicles in dynamic and strictly constrained environments. This approach integrates the path planning, collision avoidance and motion planning into a comprehensive model, which has so far not attracted a lot of attention in the academic literature, and optimizes vehicles' path and speed to minimize the completion time of a set of tasks. Simulation results demonstrated that this approach can effectively coordinate the motion of a team of vehicles, and solve the problems of traffic congestion and collision under various traffic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {We consider the multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem in an initially unknown environment. The ob-jective of the MRTA problem is to find a schedule or sequence of tasks that should be performed by a set of robots so that the cost or energy expended by the robots is minimized. Existing solutions for the MRTA problem mainly concentrate on finding an efficient task allocation among robots, without directly incorporat-ing changes to tasks' costs originating from changes in robots' paths due to dynamically detected obsta-cles while moving between tasks. Dynamically updat-ing path costs is an important aspect as changing path costs can alter the task sequence for robots that corre-sponds to the minimum cost. In this paper, we attempt to address this problem by developing an algorithm called MRTA-RTPP (MRTA with Real-time Path Planning) by integrating a greedy MRTA algorithm for task planning with a Field D*-based path planning algorithm. Our technique is capable of handling dynamic changes in a robot's path costs due to static as well as mobile ob-stacles and computes a new task schedule if the origi-nal schedule is no longer optimal due to the robots' re-planned paths. We have verified our proposed technique on physical Corobot robots that perform surveillance-like tasks by visiting a set of locations. Our experimen-tal results show that that our MRTA technique is able to handle dynamic path changes while reducing the cost of the schedule to the robots.},

The novel features of the system are: 1) it finds high-quality kinematic solutions to task-level problems; 2) it takes advantage of subtask-specific irrelevance information, reusing optimal solutions to state-abstracted subproblems across the search space. We briefly describe how the system handles uncertainty during plan execution, and present results on discrete problems as well as pick-and-place tasks for a mobile robot.},

abstract = {The multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) problem has recently received a lot of attention. However, it does not capture important characteristics of many real-world domains, such as automated warehouses, where agents are constantly engaged with new tasks. In this paper, we therefore study a lifelong version of the MAPF problem, called the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem. In the MAPD problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks in an online setting. One agent has to be assigned to each delivery task. This agent has to first move to a given pickup location and then to a given delivery location while avoiding collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled MAPD algorithms, Token Passing (TP) and Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS). Theoretically, we show that they solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them against a centralized strawman MAPD algorithm without this guarantee in a simulated warehouse system. TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD algorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary concern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents and tasks. TPTS requires limited communication among agents and balances well between TP and the centralized MAPD algorithm.},

abstract = {We consider a variant of the Multi-Agent Path-Finding problem that seeks both task assignments and collision-free paths for a set of agents navigating on a graph, while minimizing the sum of costs of all agents. Our approach extends Conflict-Based Search (CBS), a framework that has been previously used to find collision-free paths for a given fixed task assignment. Our approach is based on two key ideas: (i) we operate on a search forest rather than a search tree; and (ii) we create the forest on demand, avoiding a factorial explosion of all possible task assignments. We show that our new algorithm, CBS-TA, is complete and optimal. The CBS framework allows us to extend our method to ECBS-TA, a bounded suboptimal version. We provide extensive empirical results comparing CBS-TA to task assignment followed by CBS, Conflict-Based Min-Cost-Flow (CBM), and an integer linear program (ILP) solution, demonstrating the advantages of our algorithm. Our results highlight a significant advantage in jointly optimizing the task assignment and path planning for very dense cases compared to the traditional method of solving those two problems independently. For large environments with many robots we show that the traditional approach is reasonable , but that we can achieve similar results with the same runtime but stronger suboptimality guarantees.},

abstract = {We study the TAPF (combined target-assignment and path-finding) problem for teams of agents in known terrain, which generalizes both the anonymous and non-anonymous multi-agent path-finding problems. Each of the teams is given the same number of targets as there are agents in the team. Each agent has to move to exactly one target given to its team such that all targets are visited. The TAPF problem is to first assign agents to targets and then plan collision-free paths for the agents to their targets in a way such that the makespan is minimized. We present the CBM (Conflict-Based Min-Cost-Flow) algorithm, a hierarchical algorithm that solves TAPF instances optimally by combining ideas from anonymous and non-anonymous multi-agent path-finding algorithms. On the low level, CBM uses a min-cost max-flow algorithm on a time-expanded network to assign all agents in a single team to targets and plan their paths. On the high level, CBM uses conflict-based search to resolve collisions among agents in different teams. Theoretically, we prove that CBM is correct, complete and optimal. Experimentally, we show the scalability of CBM to TAPF instances with dozens of teams and hundreds of agents and adapt it to a simulated warehouse system.},

abstract = {This paper applies a meta-heuristic based ant colony optimization (ACO) technique for simultaneous task allocation and path planning of automated guided vehicles (AGV) in material handling. ACO algorithm allocates tasks to AGVs based on collision free path obtained by a proposed path and motion planning algorithm. The validity of this approach is investigated by applying it to different task and AGV combinations which have different initial settings. For small combinations, i.e. small number of tasks and vehicles, the quality of the ACO solution is compared against the optimal results obtained from exhaustive search mechanism. This approach has shown near optimal results. For larger combinations, ACO solutions are compared with simulated annealing algorithm which is another commonly used meta-heuristic approach. The results show that ACO solutions have slightly better performance than that of simulated annealing algorithm},
